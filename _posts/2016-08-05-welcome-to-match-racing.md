**Welcome to MATCH RACING!**

Pro, semipro, and exhibition drag racing is the coolest thing going. The NHRA big show is cool as well, but so much quarter and eighth-mile awesomeness goes on around the world on a weekly basis that you sometimes never get to see or know about. Sure, you can sign up for like a thousand Facebook groups and try to follow along, but what WE loved were those great old Drag News (and even National Dragster) issues that featured dozens and dozens of small shows from every area of the country. Now that we've had the Internet for 20 plus years, we can also find great drag racing action from every continent except Antarctic -- IF we know where to find it. 

Our aim is to make MATCH RACING the place you can open on a daily basis to find these awesome racing results. And we intend to do it in a great looking, easy to read format. We are just getting this bad boy fired up (and we didn't magically find any more time in our weeks), so it may be a while before we get going. But the way MATCH RACING works -- using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to publish the stories -- should help with that (in fact, it's why we are even trying this crazy thing!) So hang in there with us and hold on to your hats... we hope to thrill you with the color and excitement of MATCH RACING soon!
